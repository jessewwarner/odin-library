Create a library app that stores books

The purpose of this project is to create a library app that can store
books with its title, author, number of pages, and whether or not the
user has read the book. The main focus here is learning how to work 
with object in JavaScript, but I will take the oppurtunity to better
understand layouts and designs in web development.
